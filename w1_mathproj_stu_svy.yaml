# This file matches columns in a raw source file to match the names
# of variables in the codebook

# It does two things: renames columns, and recodes / replaces values
# this way, the resulting data are ready to be converted by the codebook

path: "data/input/w1_mathproj_stu_svy_raw.csv"

columns:
  # Columns that don't need to be changed can just be listed like this:
  - stu_id
  - svy_date

  # Columns can be renamed like this:
  - grade_level:
      src: grade_evel

  # Columns can be recoded as well to get ready for the codebook:
  - math1:
      remap: math_beliefs_likert

  # We can also make fixes like this:
  - math2:
      remap:
        1: "strongly disagree"
        2: "disagree"
        3: "neutral"
        4: "agree"
        "4\n": "agree"
        5: "strongly agree"

  - math3:
      remap: math_beliefs_likert

  - math4:
      remap: math_beliefs_likert
