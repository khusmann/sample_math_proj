# This is an example codebook definition that would act as the single source
# of truth for the project. This is a human AND machine-readable file! This
# means that it's easy to edit and maintain by hand, but my R package could
# read it and automatically do things with the information
#
# For example, from this definition, my package would be able to:
#
# - Generate data dictionaries for the project (similar in format to
#   data/output/mathproj_stu_svy_data-dictionary.xlsx)
#
# - Automatically create `pointblank` validators for ensuring data quality
#
# - Embed metadata into the data files themselves (e.g. *.sav files)
#
# Notice how:
#
# - scale definitions can be reused! (like `math_beliefs_likert`!)
#
# - we can easily define different versions of the data (like `restricted` and `public`),
#   and still re-use our definitions :)
